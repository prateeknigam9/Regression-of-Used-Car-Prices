# Used Car Price Regression

This project is divided into three segments, focused on predicting used car prices from a Kaggle competition dataset. You can download the dataset from Kaggle.

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I conducted exploratory data analysis on the prices and other features of used cars to understand their relationships and distributions.

## 2. Model Discovery
In this phase, I explored various machine learning models to predict used car prices. After comparing their performances, I selected the most suitable model.

## 3. End-to-End Dynamic and Distributed Model Training
This segment includes executable code to dynamically train and test the chosen model on the dataset. It generates:
- A performance metrics table
- Actual vs predicted comparisons for the train data
- Model configuration details
- Holdout predicted values

The code is designed to be easily updated and expanded upon as needed.

## The Code comprises - 
### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
 - making the code modular, reusable, and scalable, functions and methods

### Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
- Conducted detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn` to identify key patterns and trends in the data.

### Dynamic and Distributed Programming
- The model training and evaluation code is designed to handle dynamic updates and additional features as required.

## How to Run
1. Set up your configurations in `config.py`.
2. Execute `main.py`, which manages all necessary operations in the background.
